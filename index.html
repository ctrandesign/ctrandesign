        Why I like my rice cooker.
        I remember the panic and ensuing rush to the kitchen after receiving the text “Did you put the rice
        on?”. As a young girl with parents who worked full time this was often my one after school
        responsibility, apart from my homework of course. It felt like a chore at the time but after 3 years
        living away from home, I cherish the simple process that goes into making rice. The feeling of sinking
        your hand into a bag of rice to extract the right number of cups, then methodically washing the
        grains; once if I’m feeling lazy but two or even three times if I want to do it properly. Then filling up
        the water to the right height; knowing I can get it perfect just by eye. Finally, the satisfying
        mechanical click of switching the cooker on and eventually the aroma of steaming rice as I prepare
        vegetables and whatever else I decide to make that evening.
        Cooking rice is a staple in many Asian households all over the world; the rice cooker elevated this
        process by making it extremely simple and convenient to make rice. No more monitoring the pot so
        the rice doesn’t burn or overspill. And an extra space on the stove is handy especially when cooking
        for several people.

        The reason I think rice cookers became so popular is the simplicity of operation. The user has to
        simply flick a switch. Even if you forget you had rice cooking it will be waiting for you, at perfect
        temperature. It adds no extra faff or technological learning curve. I can think of so many different
        kitchen appliances where I’ve had to learn and relearn how to operate specific models. I still get the
        controls for the rings on my stove wrong. But I’ve never not known how to operate a rice cooker,
        maybe that’s part of the comfort of owning one.

        For a relatively inexpensive kitchen appliance (I think mine cost £15 from Lidl) the rice cooker packs
        in a lot of great design; and I believe the simpler (and cheaper) the model, the better the design is.
        The most basic rice cooker has the same components, a lid that allows steam to escape, an inner pot
        into which the rice and water goes, a heating element and an insulated outer pot. More modern
        ones include things like vegetable steamers and a host of different buttons and settings to cook
        different things but a traditional rice cooker only needs two modes, cook and keep warm.
        The interesting part of the design is how the rice cooker switches between modes. When you press
        the switch a permanent magnet inside keeps it depressed. The temperature inside starts to rise until
        it reaches 100°C – the boiling point of water. At this point the water inside begins to turn to steam
        which means that the temperature of the pot cannot exceed this boiling point until all of the water
        has evaporated. This is the principle of latent heat of vaporisation. Once all the water has boiled off
        the rice is cooked and the temperature of the pot can exceed 100°C. This is important, because
        remember the permanent magnet keeping the cooker in cook mode? The permanent magnet has a
        Curie temperature after which the magnet loses its ferromagnetic properties. Once the magnet
        stops working the switch can no longer be held down and therefore flicks back into the keep warm
        mode.

        Now all of this could be done easily with a microcontroller and you could add in a bunch of other
        features while you’re at it but to me there is something nice about using the physical properties of
        materials, almost like a fail-safe. Water will always boil at 100°C and magnets will always fail at their
        Curie temperature. There is something so satisfying about it, this is why I think it’s great design.
